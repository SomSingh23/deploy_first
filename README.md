# URL Shortener API

The URL Shortener API allows you to easily shorten long URLs, making them more convenient to share and manage. This README provides instructions on how to use the API to shorten URLs.

## How to Use

To shorten a URL using the API, follow these steps:

1. Make a GET request to the following endpoint:<br>

   https://som-745j.onrender.com/?url=<YOUR_LONG_URL>

   Replace `<YOUR_LONG_URL>` with the actual URL you want to shorten.

2. The server will process your request and respond with a shortened URL.

3. Use the shortened URL to access the same long URL. When you visit the shortened URL, you will be redirected to the original long URL.

## Example

Let's say you want to shorten the URL https://example.com.<br>
You would make a GET request to the following URL:<br>
https://som-745j.onrender.com/?url=https://example.com

The server will respond with a shortened URL, such as:
https://som-745j.onrender.com/308RxCDaua

You can now use the shortened URL to access the original long URL https://example.com.
